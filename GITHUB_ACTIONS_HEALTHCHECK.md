**Purpose:** Verify workflows after Sprint 4 completion  
**Expected Result:** All workflows should pass with graceful error handling  

## Workflows to Test

2. **test-ultra-basic.yml** - Ultra-basic tests that should never fail
3. **security.yml** - Security scanning
4. **docs.yml** - Documentation workflow
5. **linear-sync.yml** - Linear synchronization

## Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ Workflows trigger on push to main
- ‚úÖ Use minimal dependencies to avoid conflicts
- ‚úÖ Continue on warnings without failing
- ‚úÖ Provide useful feedback in summaries
- ‚úÖ Support graceful degradation
