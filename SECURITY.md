2. **Steps to Reproduce:** Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact:** Potential impact and severity assessment
4. **Affected Components:** Which scripts, workflows, or components are affected
5. **Suggested Fix:** If you have suggestions for fixing the issue
6. **Disclosure Timeline:** Your preferred timeline for disclosure

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 24-48 hours
- **Assessment:** Within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline:** Based on severity (see below)
- **Disclosure:** Coordinated with reporter

### 🎯 Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Fix Timeline |
|----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data breach | Immediate | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, authentication bypass | 24 hours | 7 days |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, denial of service | 48 hours | 30 days |
| **Low** | Minor information leaks, configuration issues | 1 week | Next release |

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 🔑 API Keys and Secrets

- Never commit API keys, tokens, or secrets to the repository
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive configuration
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least-privilege access principles

### 🛡️ Environment Security

- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Use official, trusted base images for containers
- Enable branch protection rules
- Require signed commits where possible

### 🔍 Code Security

- Run security scans on all code changes
- Use static analysis tools (Bandit, CodeQL)
- Validate all inputs
- Follow secure coding practices

### 🔒 Access Control

- Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Limit repository access to necessary personnel
- Regularly review access permissions
- Use strong, unique passwords

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### 🔄 Automated Security

- **Daily Security Scans:** Automated security scans run daily at 2 AM UTC
- **Dependency Scanning:** Weekly dependency vulnerability scans
- **Secrets Detection:** Automated secrets scanning on all commits
- **Container Security:** Docker image vulnerability scanning

### 📊 Security Monitoring

- **Security Dashboard:** Monitor security metrics and trends
- **Vulnerability Tracking:** Track and remediate identified vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Monitoring:** Ensure compliance with security policies
- **Incident Response:** Documented incident response procedures

### 🔍 Security Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency |
|------|---------|-----------||
| **Bandit** | Python security analysis | Every commit |
| **CodeQL** | Semantic code analysis | Every PR |
| **Semgrep** | Static analysis | Every commit |
| **Gitleaks** | Secret detection | Every commit |
| **Safety** | Dependency vulnerabilities | Weekly |
| **Trivy** | Container scanning | Every build |

## 🚨 Incident Response

### 📞 Security Incident Procedure

1. **Detection:** Identify security incident
2. **Assessment:** Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment:** Limit exposure and prevent spread
4. **Investigation:** Determine root cause and scope
5. **Remediation:** Implement fixes and mitigations
6. **Recovery:** Restore normal operations
7. **Documentation:** Document lessons learned

### 🔔 Notification Process

- **Internal Team:** Immediate notification via secure channels
- **Users:** Notification based on severity and impact
- **Public Disclosure:** Coordinated disclosure after fix deployment
