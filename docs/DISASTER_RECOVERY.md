## 🔄 Recovery Procedures

### Level 1: Script Failure Recovery

**Symptoms:** Individual script execution failures, timeout errors

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Immediate Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Check script logs
   tail -f logs/script-execution.log
   
   # Verify system status
   ./scripts/validate-dependencies.sh
   ```

2. **Rollback Procedures**
   ```bash
   # Execute automatic rollback
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   
   # Restore from last known good state
   git tag --list "rollback-*" | tail -1 | xargs git checkout
   ```

3. **System Validation**
   ```bash
   # Validate system integrity
   ./scripts/test-and-validate.sh
   
   # Verify Linear connectivity
   ./scripts/setup-linear-states.sh --verify
   ```

4. **Resume Operations**
   ```bash
   # Restart development workflow
   ./scripts/start-development.sh [ISSUE-ID]
   ```

### Level 2: Integration Failure Recovery

**Symptoms:** Linear-GitHub sync failures, API connectivity issues

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Assess Integration Scope**
   ```bash
   # Check API connectivity
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $LINEAR_API_KEY" https://api.linear.app/graphql
   gh api user
   ```

2. **Switch to Manual Mode**
   ```bash
   # Enable manual workflow mode
   export MANUAL_SYNC_MODE=true
   
   # Queue pending operations
   mkdir -p temp/pending_operations
   ```

3. **Restore Connectivity**
   ```bash
   # Refresh API tokens
   ./scripts/setup-linear-states.sh --refresh-tokens
   gh auth refresh
   ```

4. **Process Queued Operations**
   ```bash
   # Process pending sync operations
   ./scripts/process-pending-sync.sh
   
   # Validate data consistency
   ./scripts/validate-sync-consistency.sh
   ```

### Level 3: Complete System Recovery

**Symptoms:** Multiple system failures, complete workflow breakdown

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Assess System State**
   ```bash
   # Complete system diagnostic
   ./scripts/disaster-recovery-assessment.sh
   ```

2. **Implement Business Continuity**
   ```bash
   # Switch to emergency procedures
   source scripts/emergency-procedures.sh
   
   # Notify stakeholders
   ./scripts/emergency-notification.sh
   ```

3. **System Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backups
   ./scripts/restore-from-backup.sh
   
   # Rebuild integrations
   ./scripts/rebuild-integrations.sh
   ```

4. **Gradual Service Restoration**
   ```bash
   # Step-by-step service restoration
   ./scripts/gradual-restoration.sh
   ```

## 📋 Incident Response Procedures

### Incident Classification

- **P0 (Critical):** Complete system down, data loss risk
  - Response time: Immediate
  - Escalation: Immediate executive notification

- **P1 (High):** Major functionality impacted
  - Response time: 15 minutes
  - Escalation: Management notification within 30 minutes

- **P2 (Medium):** Minor functionality issues
  - Response time: 1 hour
  - Escalation: Team lead notification

- **P3 (Low):** Cosmetic or documentation issues
  - Response time: 4 hours
  - Escalation: Standard team notification

### Response Workflow

```bash
# 1. Detection and Logging
./scripts/incident-detection.sh

# 2. Assessment and Classification
./scripts/incident-assessment.sh [INCIDENT-ID]

# 3. Stakeholder Notification
./scripts/stakeholder-notification.sh [PRIORITY] [INCIDENT-ID]

# 4. Emergency Response Activation
./scripts/emergency-response.sh [INCIDENT-ID]

# 5. Root Cause Investigation
./scripts/root-cause-analysis.sh [INCIDENT-ID]

# 6. Resolution Implementation
./scripts/incident-resolution.sh [INCIDENT-ID]

# 7. Post-Incident Review
./scripts/post-incident-review.sh [INCIDENT-ID]
```

## 🔄 Business Continuity Planning

### Alternative Workflows

#### Manual Linear-GitHub Sync
```bash
# Manual issue creation
gh issue create --title "[Linear] $ISSUE_TITLE" --body "$ISSUE_DESCRIPTION"

# Manual status updates
gh issue edit $ISSUE_NUMBER --add-label "in-progress"
```

#### Offline Development Workflow
```bash
# Work without sync
export OFFLINE_MODE=true

# Queue operations for later sync
./scripts/queue-offline-operations.sh
```

#### Emergency Access Procedures
```bash
# Emergency admin access
./scripts/emergency-access.sh

# Bypass normal authentication
./scripts/emergency-bypass.sh
```

### Minimum Viable Operations

**Core Functions That Must Continue:**
- Basic git operations
- Local development environment
- Manual issue tracking
- Emergency communication

**Acceptable Temporary Losses:**
- Automated sync
- Real-time monitoring
- Advanced analytics
- Non-critical integrations

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

### Proactive Monitoring

```bash
# Real-time system health
./scripts/health-monitor.sh --continuous

# API availability monitoring  
./scripts/api-monitor.sh --interval 60

# Performance threshold monitoring
./scripts/performance-monitor.sh --thresholds high

# Security event monitoring
