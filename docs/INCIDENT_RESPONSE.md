# ðŸš¨ Incident Response Playbooks

## Overview

This document provides detailed incident response procedures for the Development Workflow - Linear â†” GitHub Integration system. These playbooks are designed to guide teams through rapid and effective incident resolution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Incident Classification System

### Severity Levels

#### P0 - Critical (System Down)
- **Definition:** Complete system failure, data loss risk, security breach
- **Response Time:** Immediate (< 5 minutes)
- **Escalation:** Immediate executive notification
- **Examples:**
  - Complete Linear-GitHub sync failure
  - Security credentials compromised
  - Data corruption detected
  - Critical script failures preventing all operations

#### P1 - High (Major Impact)
- **Definition:** Major functionality impacted, significant user disruption
- **Response Time:** 15 minutes
- **Escalation:** Management notification within 30 minutes
- **Examples:**
  - Partial sync failures affecting multiple issues
  - GitHub Actions consistently failing
  - Performance degradation > 50%
  - API rate limiting causing delays

#### P2 - Medium (Limited Impact)
- **Definition:** Minor functionality issues, workarounds available
- **Response Time:** 1 hour
- **Escalation:** Team lead notification
- **Examples:**
  - Occasional script timeouts
  - Non-critical monitoring alerts

## ðŸ”„ Standard Incident Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Detection & Initial Response (0-5 minutes)

#### 1.1 Incident Detection
```bash
# Automated detection triggers
./scripts/incident-detection.sh --auto-trigger

# Log incident creation
echo "$(date): Incident detected - $INCIDENT_ID" >> logs/incident.log
```

#### 1.3 Immediate Notifications
```bash
# P0/P1 immediate alerts
if [[ $SEVERITY == "P0" || $SEVERITY == "P1" ]]; then
    ./scripts/emergency-notification.sh $INCIDENT_ID $SEVERITY
fi
```
