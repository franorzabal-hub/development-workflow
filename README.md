## 🎯 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Git repository
- Linear API key
- GitHub CLI authenticated
- Python 3.10+ (optional, for advanced features)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/franorzabal-hub/development-workflow.git
cd development-workflow

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Set your Linear API key
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Run initial setup
./scripts/setup-linear-states.sh

# Validate all dependencies
./scripts/validate-dependencies.sh

# Install workflow aliases (optional)
./scripts/claude-aliases.sh install
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start development for a Linear issue
./scripts/start-development.sh FRA-42

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/test-and-validate.sh FRA-42

# Create PR and finish workflow
./scripts/finish-development.sh FRA-42
```

### Simplified Commands (with aliases)

```bash
# Load aliases
source scripts/claude-workflow-aliases.sh

# Simplified workflow
claude-start FRA-42    # Start development
claude-test FRA-42     # Run tests
claude-finish FRA-42   # Create PR
```

## 🛡️ Disaster Recovery

This system includes enterprise-grade disaster recovery capabilities:

```bash
# System health assessment
./scripts/disaster-recovery-assessment.sh

# Create system backup
./scripts/backup-system.sh daily

# Emergency recovery
./scripts/recovery-procedures.sh emergency

# Selective recovery
./scripts/recovery-procedures.sh selective backup.tar.gz config
```

### Recovery Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** 15 minutes for critical functions
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** 0 data loss for configurations
- **Automated Testing:** Weekly disaster recovery validation
- **Backup Strategy:** Daily/weekly/snapshot backups with encryption

## 🧪 Testing Pipeline

The testing pipeline includes:

- **Code Formatting** (Black, isort)
- **Linting** (flake8, mypy)
- **Security Scanning** (Bandit)
- **Unit Testing** (pytest with coverage)
- **Integration Testing**
- **Performance Testing**
- **Disaster Recovery Testing** (weekly automated)

### Quality Gates

- ✅ Code coverage > 90%
- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ Security scan grade A
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Disaster recovery tests pass

## 🔒 Security

- API keys are masked in logs
- Security scanning with Bandit
- Input validation for all scripts
